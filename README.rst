=============
django-useful
=============

A collection of reusable Django snippets.

Unlike other similar packages, I'll try to keep it fully tested, documented,
and compatible with several Django and Python versions.

**Work in progress**:
Currently this package is still under development, and intended for my personal
use only, so use at your own risk. New features will be added gradually.

Compatible with:

* **Python:** 2.6, 2.7
* **Django:** 1.3, 1.4
* **Celery:** 2.5, 3.0 *(optional)*

For more details, see the `Documentation`_ (incomplete).
