=============
django-useful
=============

A collection of reusable Django snippets.


Unlike other similar packages, I'll try to keep it fully tested, documented,
and compatible with several Django and Python versions.


**Travis CI build status:** |travis-ci-status|


**Work in progress**:
Currently this package is still under development, and intended mainly for my
personal use. New features will be added gradually.


**Compatible with:**

* **Python:** 2.6, 2.7
* **Django:** 1.3, 1.4

For more details, see the `Documentation`_ (incomplete).
