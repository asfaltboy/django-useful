Welcome to Django-useful's documentation!
=========================================

Django-useful is a collection of reusable Django snippets.

Unlike other similar packages, I'll try to keep it fully tested, documented,
and compatible with several Django and Python versions.


**Work in progress**:
Currently this package is still under development, and intended mainly for my
personal use. New features will be added gradually.


**Compatible with:**

* **Python:** 2.6, 2.7
* **Django:** 1.3, 1.4
* **Celery:** 2.5, 3.0 *(optional)*
